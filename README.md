- 👋 Hi, I’m Matheus Veiga (@matheussvei), student on UFRJ (Rio de Janeiro Federal University), 25 years old. I love bodybuilding as much as I love League of Legends.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a developer, as I'm falling more in love with programming as each day goes by.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and React. After these two, I'm willing to start studying C# and .Net.
- 💞️ I’m looking for any internship opportunities, to improve my skills and learn even more about the needed expertises to become a well-succeeded developer.
- 📫 You can reach me on my LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-veiga-0a9105121) and on my e-mail (matheussvei@gmail.com).

Let's go, devs!!
